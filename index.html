         <h3> Who am I? </h3>
       <p> My name is Ariyan Aghdassi, and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.  I was given the student number s3895258 which correlates to my student email s3895258@student.rmit.edu.au one and a half years ago. This is due to the fact that I originally completed both a Diploma of Surveying and an Advanced Diploma of Surveying. While deciding whether to resume Surveying as a career and enter the Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying), I came to the tough decision to change my future and decided to go into Bachelor of IT. My name is from a Persian descent as I am half Persian from my dad’s side as well as half Russian from my mum’s side. However, I was personally born in New Zealand and moved to Australia Christmas 2004, at the age of 20 months and did not receive my Australian citizenship until 2013. </p>
    <h2> What are my hobbies and interests? </h2>
 <img src= "jojo1.jpg" alt width="150" height="200p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
     <p> I am quite a big fan of gaming and have been since around the age of 4. Furthermore, the game I have played most of all is Super Smash Bros Brawl for the Nintendo Wii. The reason for this is that I really enjoyed playing it for both the multiplayer mode as well as the story mode called Subspace Emissary. This story mode brought all of Nintendo’s biggest characters together and it blew my mind at a young age. I played this game up until 2018, when Super Smash Bros Ultimate came out on December 7th as I never owned a Wii U or 3DS to play Super Smash Bros 4. In 2021, I eventually decided to build my own PC, making a GeForce RTX 3060 build which is the GPU of the system. Ever since then I have never really touched another console as PC is just too convenient and has multiple uses. Although I have a big interest in gaming, I also have an interest in watching anime and reading manga in which my favourite animanga (anime/manga) of all time is JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Written by Hirohiko Araki It is a very strange story where each part features a new protagonist going on quite a “bizarre adventure” and putting an end to each villain with some characters returning in later parts. It is very enjoyable; however, it can be very sad, and each part’s ending is bittersweet to some extent. The character designs are very unique and can be a little bit questionable for some certain characters. Overall, a 10/10 animanga for me. </p>
  <h3> Interest in IT </h3>
    <img src= "tekken31.avif" alt width="150" height="150p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
     <p> Referring back to my hobbies, my interest in IT definitely started with gaming when I first played Tekken 3 on a PlayStation One, ever since then I bought every PlayStation and even eventually expanded to other platforms such as Nintendo and PC. I was introduced to gaming by my brother who owned the PlayStation One at the time, he also showed me how to use a lot of technological devices such as cameras and phones. However, since building the PC that I mentioned before, my interest IT really expanded and felt quite an accomplishment after. I started moving towards IT over surveying as I enjoyed the aspects of IT much more. While surveying deals with technology and programs such as AutoCAD, it is very hands on compared to jobs in IT. </p>

  <h2> James Watson </h2>
  <h3> Who am I? </h3>
  <p> My name is James Watson, S3955201, s3955201@student.rmit.edu.au, I come from sydney. I recently moved to melbourne after finishing highschool and have lived there since birth. My main language is English and I am non religious. My favourite hobby is either playing tennis when I am outside or playing computer games inside. </p>
  <h3> Interest in IT </h3>
  <p> When I was 4 I got my first PC which was a laptop and have loved using technology since then. In highschool one of the first electives that i picked was IT in year 9 and 10, then in year 11 and 12 i picked SDD (software design and development), i also wanted IPT (information process technology) however only one of these could run at the time and SDD had the majority pick. My interest in IT has come from gaming, the use of computers when i was younger, my dad, and liking to code. I chose to come to RMIT because my dad had work down in Melbourne and the offers from Sydney were very slow, the first offers handed to me were RMIT before any other university. My IT experiences include: Python for 3 years, C# for a year, and a bit of Lua roughly half a year (still learning). In my studies I expect to learn some new languages relating to web development and coding, possibly more teamwork, and expand my skills for going to a job. </p>

  <h2> Klarisa Arwena Anhar </h2>
  <h3> An introduction </h3>
  <p> Hi, Hello and Good day, my name is Klarisa Arwena Anhar, and I’m a student in RMIT, I’m 18 years old – born on 1st of April 2004 – and I’m pursuing a degree in Information Technology, I graduated from high school not too long ago, so my educational background is limited (though I look forward to learning many new things during university). Also, I’m from Indonesia, but I’m hoping to get Australian citizenship one day. My native language is Indonesian, but I can speak about 3 other languages, if you count dialects (Bahasa Sunda and Bahasa Jawa) as a language that is, because although both my parents were born and raised in Indonesia, they come from two different subcultures (one Sundanese and the other Javanese) </p>
<h3> A little more about me </h3>
<p> I’m around 163cm, or  5’4 if you use feet, I’m deathly allergic to cats, I owned a tiny pet spider once, and I’ve got a deep love for gaming, drawing, anime, and cooking shows! (and sometimes, the irl cooking)</p>
<p>Although I don’t play games as often as I used to, I’m still very fond of life simulation and sandbox games, from games like Harvest Moon (very nostalgic, I had it on my PSP at age 5) to games like Minecraft (been playing from 2010) or Sims 4 and Spore. I prefer soothing games over violent ones, though I do commit a fair share of war crimes and murder in The Sims.</p>
<p>My passion for drawing and anime is somewhat intertwined, since the only things I draw are just, cute chibi fanarts of animes I’ve watched, animes like SpyxFamily, Food Wars, K-On!! and Poco’s Udon World and so on. The only reason I don't pursue art as a major is because art is a pastime, not something I would want to do as a job.</p>
<p>Now onto cooking shows! I’ve always been a foodie; I love to eat all sorts of food and I love to watch people cook all sorts of things. It’s quite therapeutic to watch people cook, frankly, but not as enjoyable when I’m the one doing the cooking myself because I hate doing the dishes :( </p>

<h2> Heng-Chia Chang </h2>
<img src= "isaac1.jpg" alt width="125" height="150p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
<p> My name is Heng-Chia Chang (Isaac) whose student number is 3860650 and email address is s3860650@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Taiwan where Portuguese called “Formosa”, which means, a beautiful island. Stinky Tofu, Pearl Milk Tea and Pig Blood Cake are the most special and unique dishes in Taiwan. I love playing basketball and my favourite NBA team is the Los Angeles Lakers due to LeBron James. I have been his fan since I was 7. Semester 2 2022 is officially my first year in RMIT University and I am excited about the new chapter in RMIT in Australia. </p>


<h2> Mitchell Groenewaldt </h2>
  <img src= "mitch1.jpg" alt width="150" height="200p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
<h3> About me </h3>
<p> My name is Mitchell Groenewaldt, I was born in Australia at the Austin Hospital, my background is half Italian on my mother’s side, half South African on my dad’s side. My mum was born in Australia, whilst my dad was born in Cape Town, South Africa. </p>
<p>In terms of culture, I usually follow the traditional Italian culture of spending lots of time with family such as my grandparents and cousins, we often catch up for a meal, commonly having something Italian, or even something light like a coffee or tea. </p>
<p>Education that I have completed consists of Year 12 VCE, and Diploma of Information Technology at RMIT.</p>
<p>One interesting fact about myself is I am a massive car enthusiast, I have been a major car fanatic ever since the age of 3, according to my parents, I could name any car, even rare cars like the Jaguar XJ220 (shown in the image below) without seeing the badge.</p>
<h3> Interest in IT </h3>
  <img src= "mitchcar.jpg" alt width="300" height="150p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
<p> My interest in IT started at the age of 4. My interest in IT mainly consists of working on computers such building PCs for not only myself but friends as well as meeting their requirements, performing maintenance such as repairs and troubleshooting, setting up routers which I had done in my Diploma of IT I enjoyed the physical aspect of hooking up routers and switches to each other, and if possible, to work on ECUs (Engine Control Unit) on cars, mainly perform ECU tuning, as ECU tuning is a very big element in the automotive industry, lots of high-end racing manufacturers such as Nissan Motorsports International (NISMO), Mugen Motorsports, Scuderia Ferrari, and many other companies (even locally) have a large demand in ECU tuners, as not many people have taken upon this role, so it combines my two favourite things, cars and IT. </p>

<h2> Neil Mathew </h2>
<h3> Personal information </h3>
<p> My name is Neil Biju Mathew, and my student ID is s3961553.  I can be contacted through my student email which is s3961553@student.rmit.edu.au.  I was born in India and I hold an Indian passport but I have been studying in Australia since 2018. Along with English, I also speak Malayalam which is my mother tongue and mainly use it with my parents and family. I completed most of my secondary education in Australia and now I am doing a Bachelor of IT at RMIT. I have been working at Hungry Jacks for about 3 years and on my way to getting certified as a manager. </p>
<p> Even though I have absolutely no skill in singing, listening to music is something I enjoy a lot, maybe a bit too much. The main genres of music I listen to are hip-hop and r&b but my taste in music spreads across various languages and artists. Soccer and track events are my fav sport activities to get involved in and I am planning to get back into it by next season. </p>
<h3> Interest in IT </h3>
<p> Ever since I was a child, I have been really interested in anything that involves batteries or any other electronic/electrical devices. Taking devices apart and messing around with it was something I enjoyed even though I never knew how to put it back together. My father being an IT professional is one of the main reasons towards my interest in technology, but it was not until the recent years that I understood the specifics of IT and how it is used around the world. RMIT came into my attention as I was looking for possible courses to do after year 12. My interest in RMIT grew after I worked for an event management service which set up the 2021 RMIT graduation. The massive event where people were rewarded their graduation certificate really made me want to graduate from RMIT one day. During my study at RMIT I am expecting to gain knowledge regarding my area of study and graduate with a bachelor’s degree by the end of the course. I later plan to use that degree to get a job in a workforce. </p>
