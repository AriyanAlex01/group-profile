         <h3> Who am I? </h3>
       <p> My name is Ariyan Aghdassi, and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.  I was given the student number s3895258 which correlates to my student email s3895258@student.rmit.edu.au one and a half years ago. This is due to the fact that I originally completed both a Diploma of Surveying and an Advanced Diploma of Surveying. While deciding whether to resume Surveying as a career and enter the Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying), I came to the tough decision to change my future and decided to go into Bachelor of IT. My name is from a Persian descent as I am half Persian from my dad’s side as well as half Russian from my mum’s side. However, I was personally born in New Zealand and moved to Australia Christmas 2004, at the age of 20 months and did not receive my Australian citizenship until 2013. </p>
    <h2> What are my hobbies and interests? </h2>
 <img src= "jojo1.jpg" alt width="150" height="200p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
     <p> I am quite a big fan of gaming and have been since around the age of 4. Furthermore, the game I have played most of all is Super Smash Bros Brawl for the Nintendo Wii. The reason for this is that I really enjoyed playing it for both the multiplayer mode as well as the story mode called Subspace Emissary. This story mode brought all of Nintendo’s biggest characters together and it blew my mind at a young age. I played this game up until 2018, when Super Smash Bros Ultimate came out on December 7th as I never owned a Wii U or 3DS to play Super Smash Bros 4. In 2021, I eventually decided to build my own PC, making a GeForce RTX 3060 build which is the GPU of the system. Ever since then I have never really touched another console as PC is just too convenient and has multiple uses. Although I have a big interest in gaming, I also have an interest in watching anime and reading manga in which my favourite animanga (anime/manga) of all time is JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Written by Hirohiko Araki It is a very strange story where each part features a new protagonist going on quite a “bizarre adventure” and putting an end to each villain with some characters returning in later parts. It is very enjoyable; however, it can be very sad, and each part’s ending is bittersweet to some extent. The character designs are very unique and can be a little bit questionable for some certain characters. Overall, a 10/10 animanga for me. </p>
  <h3> Interest in IT </h3>
    <img src= "tekken31.avif" alt width="150" height="150p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
     <p> Referring back to my hobbies, my interest in IT definitely started with gaming when I first played Tekken 3 on a PlayStation One, ever since then I bought every PlayStation and even eventually expanded to other platforms such as Nintendo and PC. I was introduced to gaming by my brother who owned the PlayStation One at the time, he also showed me how to use a lot of technological devices such as cameras and phones. However, since building the PC that I mentioned before, my interest IT really expanded and felt quite an accomplishment after. I started moving towards IT over surveying as I enjoyed the aspects of IT much more. While surveying deals with technology and programs such as AutoCAD, it is very hands on compared to jobs in IT. </p>

  <h2> James Watson </h2>
  <h3> Who am I? </h3>
  <p> My name is James Watson, S3955201, s3955201@student.rmit.edu.au, I come from sydney. I recently moved to melbourne after finishing highschool and have lived there since birth. My main language is English and I am non religious. My favourite hobby is either playing tennis when I am outside or playing computer games inside. </p>
  <h3> Interest in IT </h3>
  <p> When I was 4 I got my first PC which was a laptop and have loved using technology since then. In highschool one of the first electives that i picked was IT in year 9 and 10, then in year 11 and 12 i picked SDD (software design and development), i also wanted IPT (information process technology) however only one of these could run at the time and SDD had the majority pick. My interest in IT has come from gaming, the use of computers when i was younger, my dad, and liking to code. I chose to come to RMIT because my dad had work down in Melbourne and the offers from Sydney were very slow, the first offers handed to me were RMIT before any other university. My IT experiences include: Python for 3 years, C# for a year, and a bit of Lua roughly half a year (still learning). In my studies I expect to learn some new languages relating to web development and coding, possibly more teamwork, and expand my skills for going to a job. </p>

  <h2> Klarisa Arwena Anhar </h2>
  <h3> An introduction </h3>
  <p> Hi, Hello and Good day, my name is Klarisa Arwena Anhar, and I’m a student in RMIT, I’m 18 years old – born on 1st of April 2004 – and I’m pursuing a degree in Information Technology, I graduated from high school not too long ago, so my educational background is limited (though I look forward to learning many new things during university). Also, I’m from Indonesia, but I’m hoping to get Australian citizenship one day. My native language is Indonesian, but I can speak about 3 other languages, if you count dialects (Bahasa Sunda and Bahasa Jawa) as a language that is, because although both my parents were born and raised in Indonesia, they come from two different subcultures (one Sundanese and the other Javanese) </p>
<h3> A little more about me </h3>
<p> I’m around 163cm, or  5’4 if you use feet, I’m deathly allergic to cats, I owned a tiny pet spider once, and I’ve got a deep love for gaming, drawing, anime, and cooking shows! (and sometimes, the irl cooking)</p>
<p>Although I don’t play games as often as I used to, I’m still very fond of life simulation and sandbox games, from games like Harvest Moon (very nostalgic, I had it on my PSP at age 5) to games like Minecraft (been playing from 2010) or Sims 4 and Spore. I prefer soothing games over violent ones, though I do commit a fair share of war crimes and murder in The Sims.</p>
<p>My passion for drawing and anime is somewhat intertwined, since the only things I draw are just, cute chibi fanarts of animes I’ve watched, animes like SpyxFamily, Food Wars, K-On!! and Poco’s Udon World and so on. The only reason I don't pursue art as a major is because art is a pastime, not something I would want to do as a job.</p>
<p>Now onto cooking shows! I’ve always been a foodie; I love to eat all sorts of food and I love to watch people cook all sorts of things. It’s quite therapeutic to watch people cook, frankly, but not as enjoyable when I’m the one doing the cooking myself because I hate doing the dishes :( </p>

<h2> Heng-Chia Chang </h2>
<img src= "isaac1.jpg" alt width="125" height="150p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
<p> My name is Heng-Chia Chang (Isaac) whose student number is 3860650 and email address is s3860650@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Taiwan where Portuguese called “Formosa”, which means, a beautiful island. Stinky Tofu, Pearl Milk Tea and Pig Blood Cake are the most special and unique dishes in Taiwan. I love playing basketball and my favourite NBA team is the Los Angeles Lakers due to LeBron James. I have been his fan since I was 7. Semester 2 2022 is officially my first year in RMIT University and I am excited about the new chapter in RMIT in Australia. </p>


<h2> Mitchell Groenewaldt </h2>
  <img src= "mitch1.jpg" alt width="150" height="200p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
<h3> About me </h3>
<p> My name is Mitchell Groenewaldt, I was born in Australia at the Austin Hospital, my background is half Italian on my mother’s side, half South African on my dad’s side. My mum was born in Australia, whilst my dad was born in Cape Town, South Africa. </p>
<p>In terms of culture, I usually follow the traditional Italian culture of spending lots of time with family such as my grandparents and cousins, we often catch up for a meal, commonly having something Italian, or even something light like a coffee or tea. </p>
<p>Education that I have completed consists of Year 12 VCE, and Diploma of Information Technology at RMIT.</p>
<p>One interesting fact about myself is I am a massive car enthusiast, I have been a major car fanatic ever since the age of 3, according to my parents, I could name any car, even rare cars like the Jaguar XJ220 (shown in the image below) without seeing the badge.</p>
<h3> Interest in IT </h3>
  <img src= "mitchcar.jpg" alt width="300" height="150p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
<p> My interest in IT started at the age of 4. My interest in IT mainly consists of working on computers such building PCs for not only myself but friends as well as meeting their requirements, performing maintenance such as repairs and troubleshooting, setting up routers which I had done in my Diploma of IT I enjoyed the physical aspect of hooking up routers and switches to each other, and if possible, to work on ECUs (Engine Control Unit) on cars, mainly perform ECU tuning, as ECU tuning is a very big element in the automotive industry, lots of high-end racing manufacturers such as Nissan Motorsports International (NISMO), Mugen Motorsports, Scuderia Ferrari, and many other companies (even locally) have a large demand in ECU tuners, as not many people have taken upon this role, so it combines my two favourite things, cars and IT. </p>

<h2> Neil Mathew </h2>
<h3> Personal information </h3>
<p> My name is Neil Biju Mathew, and my student ID is s3961553.  I can be contacted through my student email which is s3961553@student.rmit.edu.au.  I was born in India and I hold an Indian passport but I have been studying in Australia since 2018. Along with English, I also speak Malayalam which is my mother tongue and mainly use it with my parents and family. I completed most of my secondary education in Australia and now I am doing a Bachelor of IT at RMIT. I have been working at Hungry Jacks for about 3 years and on my way to getting certified as a manager. </p>
<p> Even though I have absolutely no skill in singing, listening to music is something I enjoy a lot, maybe a bit too much. The main genres of music I listen to are hip-hop and r&b but my taste in music spreads across various languages and artists. Soccer and track events are my fav sport activities to get involved in and I am planning to get back into it by next season. </p>
<h3> Interest in IT </h3>
<p> Ever since I was a child, I have been really interested in anything that involves batteries or any other electronic/electrical devices. Taking devices apart and messing around with it was something I enjoyed even though I never knew how to put it back together. My father being an IT professional is one of the main reasons towards my interest in technology, but it was not until the recent years that I understood the specifics of IT and how it is used around the world. RMIT came into my attention as I was looking for possible courses to do after year 12. My interest in RMIT grew after I worked for an event management service which set up the 2021 RMIT graduation. The massive event where people were rewarded their graduation certificate really made me want to graduate from RMIT one day. During my study at RMIT I am expecting to gain knowledge regarding my area of study and graduate with a bachelor’s degree by the end of the course. I later plan to use that degree to get a job in a workforce. </p>

<h2> Team profile test results </h2>
<h2> Ariyan Aghdassi </h2>
<h3> Results of Myers-Briggs test </h3>
<img src= "ariyanmyersbriggs.jpg" alt width="250" height="500p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
<p> After taking the Myers-Briggs test and receiving the personality type commander, I have learnt quite a lot about myself. According to the test most of my personality is very even, most shockingly that I am more extraverted than introverted. This is very different to what I thought as I believe I am quite a shy person, however after seeing this result, my social life makes more sense. </p>
<p>I struggle to talk to someone if I have never spoken to them before, but as soon as I have, I have no issues at all. This result is quite beneficial as it has increased my confidence as well as ensured I am able to work in a team of people well. While looking at this result, it has come to my attention that I will most likely be the leader and create the team. This is due to the fact that the results display that I am intuitive and thinking most of the time, meaning I’ll have to be quite proactive instead of waiting for people to come to me and telling me what to do. The only issue that the results contain is that I am 79% turbulent which can cause some problems however, it can also be used as fuel for determination to challenge myself and get through all the problems that appear.</p>
<p>As stated in the ideal job, I am striving to become a data analyst, this test shows that my role would be a leader and an analyst which works perfectly as it also states that I am striving for greatness no matter the challenge. However, this can be an issue as personality that the test gave me shows that I am poor at handling emotions and can be quite impatient and arrogant in which could set me back from completing these challenges. Overall, the test results were very surprising and make a lot of sense when I compare them to my life.</p>
<h3> Results of learning style test </h3>
<p> The results of the learning style test were quite consistent with what I believe my learning style is at in which that is tactile. This shows that I am a hands-on learner and prefer learning through practicals which true when it comes to my personal learning. I am definitely a person who learns better when attempting to do work rather than watching how to do work. This can be good or bad when it comes to working in a team, this is because it would theoretically be more difficult to work with a team if they show me what to do rather than let me do it myself and ask for help if needed. Overall, this test result wasn’t all that surprising. </p>
<h3> Results of creativity quiz </h3>
<p> According to the creativity quiz, my creativity is a “work in progress” which is the strangest to me. I have always thought I am a very creative person but this quiz tries to prove me wrong in that I’m semi-creative and that I need to be more innovative. Although the quiz states I’m not entirely a creative person, I will continue to believe I am as I contain the qualities of creativity.
Those qualities contain open-minded, flexible, intuitive, and risk-taking. I am definitely an open-minded person and am willing to find new ideas to solve problems that arise. This can definitely help when working in a team as I am able to listen to the team members and use their ideas which allows me too also be flexible. I’ll be able to solve issues efficiently when they occur as well as be intuitive to taking risks that will allow me to also solve issues effectively. </p>

<h2> James Watson </h2>
<h3> Results of Myers-Briggs test </h3>

<h2> Klarisa Arwena Anhar </h2>
<h3> Results of Myers-Briggs test </h3>
<p> I’ve taken the Myers-Briggs test a few times over the years, out of curiosity, and I’ve noticed that I’ve been quite consistent with my personality type; The Campaigner, or ENFP.</p>
<p>According to the test, ENFPs are “social butterflies” who are friendly, warm, enthusiastic, outgoing, lively, and upbeat. The types of people who love to spend time and make emotional connections with others, and are often the “life of the party” since they tend to stand out. ENFPs are free-spirits who are strongly passionate with the things they’re interested in, and are incredibly creative with their imaginations. Unfortunately, they can be quite a bit too disorganised and overthink because they get too attached to people.</p>
<p>With all of this in mind, I’d like to say that I’m not really that extroverted, I would consider myself more of an ambivert – shy with new people but very loud and chaotic with people they’re familiar with – but overall I believe that the test is quite accurate. Those who know me say that I’ve got a pleasant disposition, with a calming yet chaotic vibe, and it’s true that I’ve got a whole lot of ideas and concepts in my head, and I do hyperfixate on things that fascinates me.</p>
<p>In job terms, I feel like this would make me a wonderful team player, since I’m quite good at cooperating with team members, and I’m quite open-minded to diverse types of personalities and strive to understand different people in-depth. I prefer not to be a leader because although I enjoy taking charge and initiative with my ideas, I find it hard to put in the hard work when I’m not 100% into the project, and if it goes south, I’ll probably overthink it to the point of a panic attack.</p>
<h3> Results of learning style test </h3>
<p> The results for my learning styles test are, not so surprisingly, a tie between auditory and visual learner, which makes sense because I do tend to learn better when people show me how to do things themselves, and I understand things better once I get a good grasp on the concept. Unfortunately, I feel intimidated when I dive head first into a hands-on experience, and I feel a little lost without guidance or help, and that would probably make me a better follower than a leader if I’m being honest. </p>
<h3>Results of big five personality test </h3>
<p>Through the Big Five Personality (OCEAN) test I’ve discovered that I’m an intensely open and extroverted person, who is very agreeable and not very disciplined, which I’d say is quite accurate.. Except the part that says I'm over 75% extroverted. I’ve mentioned above that I’m mostly talkative when it’s with someone I’m familiar with, but I’m gradually starting to see why I’m labelled as extroverted a whole lot; although I’m shy I can still talk to strangers no problem, and I have no problems in making friends or connections, mostly because I’m very open with my opinions and I’m rarely ever judgmental. In addition to that, the fact that I try awfully hard to make a good impression on new people would make me come off as agreeable… maybe to the point of becoming a pushover sometimes. I’m also aware that I lack discipline from my impulsiveness and extreme last-minute procrastination, but it’s something I’m working hard on, and so far it hasn’t really affected my work ethic much, because I do get the job done in the end, and I don’t mind trying new things.</p>

<h2> Heng-Chia Chang </h2>
<h3> Results of Myers-Briggs test </h3>
<img src= "isaacmyersbriggs.jpg" alt width="200" height="400p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
<p> After completing the online Myers-Briggs test, I found that I am a logistician. The result is quite similar to my personality, for example, stubborn, honest and judgement etc. The result is kind of to value myself and to prove I am on the right track of my ideal career. By doing the Myers-Briggs test I have a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of myself and then I can strengthen my weaknesses or drawbacks. On the other hand, I get to know more about my advantages and to maintain them. Myers-Briggs test lets me have more time to adjust my habits to experience better in a group. </p>
<p>Myers-Briggs tests have mentioned some weaknesses and strengths about my personality which I can improve in teamwork especially. It mentions that I am not a talkative person and I am not good at drawing attention. With this, my ideas might be ignored by other teammates or crew members. It also talks about how a logistician is the most careful and likely personality type to avoid risk or to come up with an idea for an unpredictable situation. Having a person doing the business very carefully and barely making mistakes might be one of the best things in any team in the world. Logistician can somewhat foresee what is going to happen and it creates more time for the team to resolve the problems. </p>
<p>If I have a chance to build a team on my own based on the Myers-Briggs test, I would prefer my team members to have similar personality types to mine, which is logisticians. Same personality type of people on the same team probably would have a better experience, better communication and similar thoughts. Having the same type of personality on the same team could be a good signal, but ideas could be too monotonous. Having some different types of personality can help me to get a variety of different ideas and aspects which these ideas and aspects I cannot come up with. Eventually, I would build a team based on the same personality type and interspersed with different personality types to have a better experience, performance or atmosphere. </p>

<h2> Mitchell Groenewaldt <h2>
<h3> Results of Myers-Briggs test </h3>
<img src="mitchmyersbriggs.jpg" alt width="400" height="250p">
<p> The results state that I am a Consul personality, meaning that I am a very supportive, social, and well-mannered person. This means to me that I have the skills and personality to work well with others, even in a team, I can either work as a team leader, or team supporter (helping the team achieve goals or resolve any issues). Also, I have discovered that this also means I am very supportive and can help others when they are in need. </p>
<h3> Results of online learning style test </h3>
<p> From the test, I have discovered that I am both a Visual and Tactile learner, I found this rather unsurprising, as I’ve always found when it came towards learning and working, I’d always prefer to be shown how to do things, along with also having a physical attempt or practical work with the topic at hand. I struggle to learn when I am being shown PowerPoints/Presentations, as I am sitting inactive, and my brain starts to struggle to focus and learn as I am not seeing nor physically doing anything. Visual learning such as interesting videos or being physically taught, keeps me focused, and helps me learn. Along with physical practical work, as I get to perform trial and error, which also keeps me focused. </p>
<h3> Results of creativity test </h3>
<p>My creativity test shows that I have a “work in progress” form of creativity, the results had surprised me as I honestly thought I had lost my creativity from using it all up as child, but I suppose these results show I still have some creativity left in me, and perhaps it is slowly developing back. I personally feel I am not very creative, as a lot of times I go to organise something with friends whether it be a game or day out, I usually struggle to come up or decide on anything. I feel my creativity is limited to certain areas that I have a strong interest and passion in such as cars as an example. </p>

<h2> Neil Mathew </h2>
<h3> Results of Myers-Briggs test </h3>
<p> The results of the above gives me an idea of what my personality, learning style and creativity level are. Even though I don’t believe it is 100% accurate, I think it provides a good outline which can be used to identify my strengths and weaknesses. The Myers-Briggs test shows that I am an extroverted person who is intuitive and works mainly on feeling rather than thinking. I don’t believe this completely describes my personality, but I see some sense it. The learning style test shows that I am a visual learner which I agree to. I have always felt that I learn better through visuals and actual demonstrations. The creativity shows my creativity level to be “work in progress”. I believe this is due to me not following up with my ideas rather just scraping it halfway. </p>
<p> The above results show that I am an extroverted person who goes off by their emotions most of the time. These results do not completely define me, and I am confident in my ability to work in a team. From my current and previous experiences, working in a team is something that I enjoy and consider my strength. My “work in progress” level of creativity is something that I need to work on in order to be able to effectively contribute to a creative team. Even though I am a visual learner, I am confident in my ability to understand verbal information. By putting more effort into both visual and auditory learning, I believe I will be able to work effectively in a team. </p>
<p> The main things that I should consider when forming a team is my ability to understand and communicate effectively with my team members. Forming a team of people with similar personality traits and learning style is the best and easiest way. However, I believe that having different types of people with different attributes and skills are a key part of forming an efficient team. Working around the challenges that arise should also be a key part when considering team formation. </p>
