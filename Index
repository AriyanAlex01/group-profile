   <h1> Welcome To My Profile </h1>
     <h2> Personal Information </h2>
     <img src= "AriyanPic.jpg" alt width="150" height="200p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
       <h3> Who am I? </h3>
        <p> My name is Ariyan Aghdassi, and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.  I was given the student number s3895258 which correlates to my student email s3895258@student.rmit.edu.au one and a half years ago. This is due to the fact that I originally completed both a Diploma of Surveying and an Advanced Diploma of Surveying. While deciding whether to resume Surveying as a career and enter the Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying), I came to the tough decision to change my future and decided to go into Bachelor of IT. My name is from a Persian descent as I am half Persian from my dad’s side as well as half Russian from my mum’s side. However, I was personally born in New Zealand and moved to Australia Christmas 2004, at the age of 20 months and did not receive my Australian citizenship until 2013. </p>
     <h2> What are my hobbies and interests? </h2>
  <img src= "jojo.gif" alt width="300" height="150p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
      <p> I am quite a big fan of gaming and have been since around the age of 4. Furthermore, the game I have played most of all is Super Smash Bros Brawl for the Nintendo Wii. The reason for this is that I really enjoyed playing it for both the multiplayer mode as well as the story mode called Subspace Emissary. This story mode brought all of Nintendo’s biggest characters together and it blew my mind at a young age. I played this game up until 2018, when Super Smash Bros Ultimate came out on December 7th as I never owned a Wii U or 3DS to play Super Smash Bros 4. In 2021, I eventually decided to build my own PC, making a GeForce RTX 3060 build which is the GPU of the system. Ever since then I have never really touched another console as PC is just too convenient and has multiple uses. Although I have a big interest in gaming, I also have an interest in watching anime and reading manga in which my favourite animanga (anime/manga) of all time is JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Written by Hirohiko Araki It is a very strange story where each part features a new protagonist going on quite a “bizarre adventure” and putting an end to each villain with some characters returning in later parts. It is very enjoyable; however, it can be very sad, and each part’s ending is bittersweet to some extent. The character designs are very unique and can be a little bit questionable for some certain characters. Overall, a 10/10 animanga for me. </p>
   <h2> Interest in IT </h2>
     <h3> What is my interest in IT? And when did it start? </h3>
      <p> Referring back to my hobbies, my interest in IT definitely started with gaming when I first played Tekken 3 on a PlayStation One, ever since then I bought every PlayStation and even eventually expanded to other platforms such as Nintendo and PC. I was introduced to gaming by my brother who owned the PlayStation One at the time, he also showed me how to use a lot of technological devices such as cameras and phones. However, since building the PC that I mentioned before, my interest IT really expanded and felt quite an accomplishment after. I started moving towards IT over surveying as I enjoyed the aspects of IT much more. While surveying deals with technology and programs such as AutoCAD, it is very hands on compared to jobs in IT. </p>

<img src= "Rmit.jpg" alt width="200" height="200p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">

    <h3> Why did I choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
      <p> I chose to study a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT as I had completed the Diploma of Surveying and Advanced Diploma of Surveying that I had stated before at RMIT. I chose to do those two courses at RMIT as it was most beneficial to me as RMIT is great for TAFE, therefore it made the most sense to do the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT since I am used to all the aspects of RMIT such as the campuses and Canvas as well as already having the student email and ID card established. This made enrolling into the course much easier as I had less material to prepare and complete. </p>

    <h3> What do I expect to learn during my studies? </h3>
      <p> There is quite a lot that I expect to learn to an extent. Being able to build a website confidently without struggle is something I believe I will learn how to complete while studying. Although the website itself may not be professional, it may be to a good standard that would be acceptable for anyone. I also expect to be able to do quite basic programming however, I may learn how to do some more advanced programming during my studies that can help me with the future. I would use this knowledge to program a small game as a personal challenge. While that is what I believe I will learn through my studies, I also believe I will learn a lot about databases such as creating them and keeping them updated as well as learning the basics of computer systems. While not how to build a computer or what parts a computer does, but more about the aspects of how a computer reads programs and the aspects of binary such as number systems and gates. </p>

    <h2> Ideal Job </h2>
    <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57916701?type=standout#sol=84587f947513744b8a41a9db41217f40056dfb09">Click here for job advertisement</a>

     <h3> What is my ideal job? </h3>

<img src="SeekAd.jpg" alt width="750" height="500p">
      <p> The job that I’m striving to get into is data analytics as a data analyst. One area in data analyst that is ideal for me is database development, in which I have found a job listing that contains exactly that. The link and image above are a recent job listing from a company called Fujitsu, an air conditioner company that originated in Japan back in 1935. </p>

    <h3> What does a data analyst do? </h3>
      <p> As a data analyst, databases are priority which includes using tools and database language whereupon will allow for developing a database and maintaining it to keep it running smoothly. This includes fixing any errors that materialize such as data issues. </p>

    <h3> Why is this job ideal? </h3>
       <p> This position is appealing to me as there are many benefits to data analyst is a large amount of job availabilities in Australia and especially in Melbourne. While job availabilities are quite appealing, the main attraction is the pay that a data analyst earns, in which the average is $99,000 annually according to different job listings and can go upwards of $140,000. </p>

     <h3> What skills and qualifications are required? </h3>
       <p> While the job and pay of a data analyst is one that people endeavour, there is a lot of skills, qualifications and experience that is needed to surpass the requirements for the job. This includes an advanced knowledge of database language that I mentioned before. There is quite a lot of different types of database language that have their pros and cons, however the main one that most people and companies use is SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL allows for information to be created, inserted into and taken from relational databases and separates them into tuples and attributes. For this exact job listing, the experience needed is 12 months working in a data related role. This mostly refers to most information technology jobs that handle any type of data. </p>

    <h3> What skills do I currently have and how can I gain more? </h3>
       <p> While I am working to get into this job, the skills and knowledge I have is very beginner and just the base of database and programming. While I only know very little, I am able to create something with little effort, however that is not at all acceptable for a job such as data analyst. Thankfully, studying at RMIT, I will gain the necessary skills and qualities needed for the job and will set me to the direction needed. The courses contain database and programming aspects, perfect for a data analyst. </p>



     <h2> Personal Profile </h2>
       <h3> Results of Myers-Briggs test </h3>
         <p> After taking the Myers-Briggs test and receiving the personality type commander, I have learnt quite a lot about myself. According to the test most of my personality is very even, most shockingly that I am more extraverted than introverted. This is very different to what I thought as I believe I am quite a shy person, however after seeing this result, my social life makes more sense. I struggle to talk to someone if I have never spoken to them before, but as soon I have, I have no issues at all. This result is quite beneficial as it has increased my confidence as well as ensured I am able to work in a team of people well. While looking at this result, it has come to my attention that I will most likely be the leader and create the team. This is due to the fact that the results display that I am intuitive and thinking most of the time, meaning I’ll have to be quite proactive instead of waiting for people coming to me and telling me what to do. The only issue that the results contain is that I am 79% turbulent which can cause some problems however, it can also be used a fuel for determination to challenge myself and get through all the problems that appear. As stated in the ideal job, I am striving to become a data analyst, this test shows that my role would be a leader and an analyst which works perfectly as it also states that I am striving for greatness no matter the challenge. However, this can be an issue as personality that the test gave me shows that I am poor at handling emotions and can be quite impatient and arrogant in which could set me back from completing these challenges. Overall, the test results were very surprising and make a lot of sense when I compare them to my life. </p>

<img src="personality.jpg" alt width="300" height="600p">

     <h3> Results of Learning Style test </h3>
       <p> The results of the learning style test were quite consistent with what I believe my learning style is at in which that is tactile. This shows that I am a hands-on learner and prefer learning through practicals which true when it comes to my personal learning. I am definitely a person who learns better when attempting to do work rather than watching how to do work. This can be good or bad when it comes to working in a team, this is because it would theoretically be more difficult to work with a team if they show me what to do rather than let me do it myself and ask for help if needed. Overall, this test result wasn’t all that surprising. </p>

     <h3> Results of Creativity Quiz </h3>
      <p> According to the creativity quiz, my creativity is a “work in progress” which is the strangest to me. I have always thought I am a very creative person but this quiz tries to prove me wrong in that I’m semi-creative and that I need to be more innovative. Although the quiz states I’m not entirely a creative person, I will continue to believe I am as a contain the qualities of creativity. Those qualities contain open-minded, flexible, intuitive and risk-taking. I am definitely an open-minded person and am willing to find new ideas to solve problems that arise. This can definitely help when working in a team as I am able to listen to the team members and use their ideas which allows me to also be flexible. I’ll be able to solve issues efficiently when they occur as well as be intuitive to taking risks that will allow me to also solve issues effectively. </p>

    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
     <h3>Overview, what is my project? </h3>
      <p> The project that I am planning on completing is a game using unity called Platevo pronounced plat evo. This game is a platforming game with a fun twist. What is this twist you may ask? My answer is evolution, in which the game starts out in 8-bit and ends up with 4k HD graphics. But you may be also asking, how this might work with the game? Each world will contain aspects of generations of games which means the first worlds will contain less bits as well as simpler music and designs compared to later the worlds which would have more intense graphics and music.</p>

    <h3>What is my motivation?</h3>
     <p>My motivation for creating a game of this calibre is that I am a huge fan of gaming as stated before and have always wanted to make my own game that I can release to the public. However, I’ve always wanted to make a game that was completely different to majority of games out there that’s has a unique feature. Platformers are my all-time favourite genre of gaming as well, from a young age playing games on PS1 like Crash Bandicoot all the way up to games on Nintendo Switch like Super Mario 3D World Deluxe.  Overall, I believe that a new platformer is needed that does platforming differently while also adding in that hint of nostalgia to appeal to the older generation which is why Platevo is my project.</p>

    <h3> Description of the item</h3>
      <p> The game will be released on PC as a download or on the steam store and will be released on other platformers so long as there is a lot of traction gained around the game. The game will contain 6 different, unique worlds that will be a mix of 2d and 3d aspects. World 1 and 2 will be in 2d and world 3-6 will be in 3d. </p>

<img src= "Steam.jpg" alt width="200" height="200p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">

    <h3> Why is the world design like this </h3>
      <p> If you’re asking why? I can tell you; this is the whole gimmick of the game that sets it apart from other games. This is due to the fact that world 1 will have an 8-bit graphic inspired environment and world 2 will have 16-bit graphic environment which mean they cannot necessarily be in 3d compared to the other worlds. World 3 will be 64-bit inspired, therefore the graphics will look very rough as it will look as if there is less polygons which is very similar to the actual 64-bit games of the late nineties era and will appeal to the 30-year old’s that want to feel a sense of nostalgia. World 4 will have graphics that look quite similar to games that come from the early 2000’s era that were on consoles such as the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube. While it will also look a little rough, it will be much smoother than the graphical look of world 3 as it will look as there’s more polygons. Worlds 5 and 6 are very similar in graphical looks, in that they are both high definitions, however world 5 will be the very early stages of HD and world 6 will be the later 4k stages of HD that has features such as ray tracing which will appeal to this generation’s gamers. </p>

    <h3> What about the character and bosses? </h3>
      <p> In this game, you can customize your character and watch as they slowly upgrade their looks after beating the 10 levels in each of the worlds. You will have to take your character that you can name and get to each boss in level 10 of each world and beat them. Each boss will take inspiration from similar characters from each era of gaming like a big monster or an evil soldier. It would be a fun call back to older games that the gamer can make and relate to. The final boss in world 6 would be a mix of the previous 5 bosses in the previous worlds that would be much harder to beat. Before getting to the bosses though, there will be a lot of enemies and hazards that the player will have to beat or dodge to keep moving otherwise they will most likely lose a life. </p>

    <h3> Are there any extra features I should know? </h3>
       <p> Each world will also contain collectable cards that reflect the era that they based of. These cards will contain an item such as a gem in the 8-bit area or a memory card in the early 64-bit era and can be viewed in the extras that will showcase each nostalgic item. </p>

    <h3> Why are you releasing this game for free? </h3>
       <p>Overall, this game will be offered for free as a download or on Steam as it would be the first game that I would have made, and I would rather achieve feedback and traction over money. </p>

  <h3> What Tools and technologies am I using? </h3>
    <p>As stated, before I am using Unity, a cross-platform game engine to produce this game. I am using Unity as it allows for both 2d and 3d game creation which is extremely useful for what I am creating as well as the fact that it contains a lot of other useful features. Some of these features include gameplay and storytelling which allows for certain camera shots and unique animations that can be used. Unity is also good as it is much easier to use compared to other game engines as well as it has tips in order to help me create the game. Overall, Unity will allow me to create my game to a standard that I would be happy with as well as guide me into the right direction if any issue transpires.</p>

<img src= "Python.jpg" alt width="200" height="200p;" style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">

  <h3> What skills are required? </h3>
   <p> The main skill that is essentially required is programming and scripting language skills using C# which is similar to Python 3 in some aspects. This won’t be too difficult to learn as there is quite a lot of tutorials online and I can also learn through content on RMIT’s Canvas which also has a decent number of tutorials. I can do this on my PC which is definitely powerful enough as it contains a GeForce RTX 3060 and 32gb of RAM. Essentially, I already have the hardware needed to create the game, I just need to obtain the software and learn how to use it to an acceptable standard. </p>

  <h3> Outcome </h3>
   <p>The outcome of this project is a unique game that will fill the need for something different that anyone can play. This will all solve the issue of originality as majority of games in this decade feel like copy and pastes of other games. This game could also be the foundation for other games to be produced that are very similar like other genres of gaming that go through evolution such as a fighting game. Overall, I believe this project will be a success however, it will require a lot of work in order to create to an acceptable standard.</p>
